>M. Fanuel and H. Tyagi, Recovering Hölder smooth functions from noisy
modulo samples


A few implementations of denoising/unwrapping methods were shared with us by M. Cucuringu; see the following paper
>M. Cucuringu and H. Tyagi. Provably robust estimation of modulo 1 samples of a smooth function with applications to phase unwrapping. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(32):1–77, 2020.
